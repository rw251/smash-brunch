# Images
`app/assets/img/` contains icon images at various resolutions. I find the best approach is to create an icon at 512x512 pixels, then use something like GIMP to resize it and save at each of the other resolutions. The smaller images are for favicons and the larger are for if and when users save them to their devices homescreen.
